# Udacity_Project3_Analyze_A-B_Test_Results
Third Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project.

# Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important to get some practice working with the difficulties of these. 

***A Step-by-step solution is provided!***

# Project Overview
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Why this Project?
In this project, I am able to show that I have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree lessons. 
I learned how to use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels and Spicy.
